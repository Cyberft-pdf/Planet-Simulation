# Planet-Simulation

<p>The Planet Simulation project, implemented using Python and Pygame, provides a visual representation of planetary movements and interactions in a virtual space.</p>
<p>It utilizes the principles of physics and gravitational forces to simulate the orbits and positions of celestial bodies. The simulation includes planets such as Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus, allowing users to observe their movements and explore the dynamics of the solar system.</p>
